            <h3>Support the Journey</h3>
            <p>
                We live in a world with boundless resources and tools to help reps sell and do more. What we see a lack of, are the resources to help those individuals using the tools. It doesn't matter how much talent, skills, or abilities a rep has. If they are feeling burnt out or anxious about not being able to hit their number then all the other tools are useless.<br><br>
                These feelings of anxiety, fear, and burnout are often not optional for individuals in sales. That is where our journey began. After realizing there were little to no resources to address this issue we stepped up to the challenge. Our mission is to educate and equip sales reps with the tools and strategies to recognize when mental health begins to decline, improve mental health, build resilience, and offload stress so they can feel their best and be their best, both inside and outside of work.<br><br>
                In the performance-driven industry of professional sports teams are required to have on-call/on-site performance coaches to help athletes unlock and maintain a state of peak performance (insert -FlowState-) due to the high-pressure atmosphere they play in. We don't believe sales is any different. So we created a platform for organizations to feel and perform at their very best.
